# Frequently Asked Questions

## What should I bring to the ride?

- A bike in good working condition

## How do we promote safety?

Safety is <u>the</u> top priority. We strive to create a secure environment for everyone to enjoy the ride. This includes:

- **Taking Full Lanes**: To ensure the safety of all cyclists, we take full 
lanes when necessary, especially where there are double yellow lines, to 
discourage unsafe passing by cars.
- **Corking when Necessary**: In order to keep the mass together, we may cork intersections until
we have all safely navigated the intersection.
- **Pre-Ride Safety Checks**: Make sure your stuff works and can be ridden. Don't know what to look for?
