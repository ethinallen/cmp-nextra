# Welcome to Critical Mass Princeton

Critical Mass Princeton is a community bike ride to give everyone the opportunity to safely recreate the streets of downtown Princeton. It is about fostering a sense of community, where bicycle enjoyers of all ages and abilities can recreate and experience the joy of riding together. The only goal is to provide a welcoming space where we can collectively create a positive and safe experience for each other while enjoying the shared freedom of biking in our beautiful town.

## What is Critical Mass?

Critical Mass is not just a bike ride, but a movement that celebrates cycling and the rights of cyclists. It's a global phenomenon, adapted locally by communities to highlight local issues and bring people together.

## Why Princeton?

Princeton, with its rich history and vibrant community, offers the perfect backdrop for communal activities like cycling. Our rides aim to highlight the beauty and accessibility of our town's streets and public spaces.
