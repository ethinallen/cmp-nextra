# Welcome to Critical Mass Princeton

Critical Mass Princeton is a community bike ride to give everyone the opportunity to 
safely recreate the streets of downtown Princeton. It is about fostering a sense of 
community, where bicycle enjoyers of all ages and abilities can recreate and experience 
the joy of riding together. The only goal is to provide a welcoming space where we can 
collectively create a positive and safe experience for each other while enjoying the 
shared freedom of biking in our beautiful town.

## What is Critical Mass?

Critical Mass is not just a bike ride, but a movement that celebrates cycling and the 
rights of cyclists. It's a global phenomenon, adapted locally by communities to highlight 
local issues and, above all else, <u>bring people together</u>.
