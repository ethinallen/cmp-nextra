# Welcome to Critical Mass Princeton

Critical Mass Princeton is a community bike ride to give everyone the opportunity to 
safely recreate the streets of downtown Princeton. It is about fostering a sense of 
community, where bicycle enjoyers of all ages and abilities can recreate and experience 
the joy of riding together. The only goal is to provide a welcoming space where we can 
collectively create a positive and safe experience for each other while enjoying the 
shared freedom of biking in our beautiful town.

## What is Critical Mass?

Critical Mass is not just a bike ride, but a movement that celebrates cycling and the 
rights of cyclists. It's a global phenomenon, adapted locally by communities to highlight 
local issues and, above all else, <u>bring people together</u>.

discourage unsafe passing by cars.

# What this ride is and how to talk about it.

Critical Mass Princeton is a bike ride that is dedicated to creating a safe, inclusive, and community-oriented environment for all participants. Hereâ€™s how we achieve these goals:


## No Politics

Critical Mass Princeton takes no political stances but its attendants almost 
certainly do; come bike with us to hear about the variety of motivations that 
bring us together. This is a ride focused on community and cycling joy, not 
political discourse.

Join us to experience the joy of cycling together in a safe, welcoming, and 
community-focused environment.


## Safety

Safety is our top priority. We strive to create a secure environment for everyone to enjoy the ride. This includes:

- **Taking Full Lanes**: To ensure the safety of all cyclists, we take full 
lanes when necessary, especially where there are double yellow lines, to 
discourage unsafe passing by cars.
- **Corking when Necessary**: In order to keep the mass together, we may cork intersections until
we have all safely navigated the intersection.
- **Pre-Ride Safety Checks**: Encouraging all riders to perform safety checks 
on their bicycles before joining the ride.

## Inclusivity

Critical Mass Princeton is committed to being an inclusive event that welcomes families and bicycle enjoyers of all ages and abilities:

- **No Drop Ride**: We maintain a pace that accommodates our slowest rider, 
ensuring no one is left behind.
- **Family-Friendly**: We actively encourage families to participate, making 
it a fun experience for riders young and old.
- **Support for All Riders**: As a community, we look out for each other. 
If a problem arises during the ride, we come together to find a solution, 
ensuring everyone can continue to enjoy the event safely.

## Community

Community is the natural outcome of our commitment to safety and inclusivity:

- **Shared Experiences**: By riding together, we share experiences that foster 
a strong sense of belonging and community spirit.
- **Post-Ride Gatherings**: After each ride, participants are encouraged to 
gather, share their experiences, and enjoy local amenities.
- **Community Feedback**: We actively seek and incorporate feedback from 
participants to improve the ride experience for everyone.

## We are the intersection of <b><i>Community</i></b> and <b><i>Mobility</i></b>

While Critical Mass Princeton is fundamentally focused on providing a safe 
and enjoyable biking experience, we recognize that cycling can intersect 
with political topics. Discussions about cycling's role in our community 
and its impact on public policy may naturally arise among participants. 
However, it's important to note that these discussions are not the primary 
goal of our rides. The primary objective is to foster a welcoming environment 
for all to enjoy the freedom and joy of cycling, without an agenda to 
promote political discourse. We have fun and we look out for each other. 
Anything beyond this is a bonus but not a stated goal.
